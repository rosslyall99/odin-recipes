    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b></b>For the base</b>
            <ul> 300g strong bread flour</ul>
            <ul> 1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</ul>
            <ul>1 tsp salt</ul>
            <ul> 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>For the tomato sauce</b>
            <ul>100ml passata</ul>
            <ul>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</ul>
            <ul>1 garlic clove, crushed</ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>For the topping</b>
            <ul>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</ul>
            <ul>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</ul>
            <ul>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>To finish</b>
            <ul>handful of basil leaves (optional)</ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml
            warm
            water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn
            onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You
            can
            leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at
            room
            temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a
            floured
            surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be
            very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in
            the
            oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes,
            drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet
            or
            tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat
            step
            for remaining pizza.</li>
    </ol>
